# Notice

Give a simple notice at the top of a page, dismissable with a click. Makes use of the `-webkit-appearance: searchfield-cancel-button` on Chrome and Safari, a `âœ•` on other browsers.

# Usage

## manual way

Link both `style.css` and `notice.js` in your html file. Then in a script you can make a new notice by doing

```js
notice('with text');
notice('with webkit close button',webit);
```

## browserify
You need to install this via npm first like this:

```sh
npm install --save git+https://github.com/haroenv/notice.git
```

Just require notice as any other CommonJS module after installing it via npm:

```javascript
var notice = require('notice');
```

In terms of CSS you have to decide whether you reference the CSS file, which is in the `node_modules` folder or use a tool like [parcelify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcelify) to bundle the CSS.
